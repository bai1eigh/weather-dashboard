# <Weather-Dashboard>

## Description
- 'Weather Dashboard' provides users the ability to search their cities current weather conditions. When a city is searched the site presents the current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. It also presents a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- From this project I familiarized myself with server-side APIs
